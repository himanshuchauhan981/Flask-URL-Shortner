# Flask-URL-Shortener
Sometimes we need to share or send links and this can be tiresome and annoying to copy and paste long URLs. That is where URL Shortener comes. Not only it helps in shortening the URL but it also allows user to copy the shortened URL with a click of a button.
In this project, user can save the shortened URL and can view those URL anytime by logging into the account that user has created. Further, user can delete URL if he/she does not want it.
